- Sort your ideas for activities into top-level activities, category activities, and detail/edit activities. Use the category activities to navigate from the top-level activities to the detail/edit activities.

- Image resources go in one or more of the drawable* folders. You reference them in your layout using 
`@drawable/image_name`. You access them in your activity code using `R.drawable.image_name`.

- An **ImageView** holds an image. Add it to your layout using `<ImageView>`. Use `android:src` to set its source, and `android:contentDescription` to give it an accessible label. The equivalent methods in Java are 
`setImageResource()` and `setContentDescription()`.

- A **ListView** displays items in a list. Add it to your layout using `<ListView>`.

- Use `android:entries` in your layout to populate the items in your list views from an array defined in *strings.xml*.

- A **ListActivity** is an Activity that comes with a `ListView`. You get a reference to the `ListView` using `getListView()`.
  - A `ListActivity` has its own default layout, but you can replace it with your own.

- An **adapter** acts as a bridge between an `AdapterView` and a data source. `ListViews` and `Spinners` are both types of `AdapterView`.

- An **ArrayAdapter** is an adapter that works with arrays.

- Handle click events on Buttons using `android:onClick` in the layout code.

- Handle click events on a `ListView` in a `ListActivity` by implementing the `onListItemClick()` method.

- Handle click events elsewhere by creating a listener and implementing its click event.
