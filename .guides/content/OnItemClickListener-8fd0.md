When you want to get items in a list view to respond to clicks, you need to create an **OnItemClickListener** and implement its **onItemClick() method**.

The OnItemClickListener listens for when items are clicked, and the onItemClick() method lets you say how your activity should respond to the click. 

The onItemClick() method includes several parameters that you can use to find out which item was clicked, such as a reference to the view item that was clicked, its position in the list view (starting at 0), and the row ID of the underlying data.


We want to start DrinkCategoryActivity when the first item in the list view is clicked—the item at position 0. If the item at position 0 is clicked, we need to create an intent to start DrinkCategoryActivity. 

Here’s the code to create the listener:
