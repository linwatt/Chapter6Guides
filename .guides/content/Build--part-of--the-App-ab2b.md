Rather than build all the category and detail/edit activities required for the entire Starbuzz app, we’re going to focus on just the drinks. 


We’re going to build a top-level activity that the user will see when they launch the app, a category activity that will display a list of drinks, and a detail/edit activity that will display details of a single drink.

When the user launches the app, they will be presented with the top-level activity, the main entry point of the app. This activity includes an image of the Starbuzz logo, and a navigational list containing entries for Drinks, Food, and Stores. 

When the user clicks on an item in the list, the app uses the selection to navigate to a separate activity. As an example, if the user clicks on Drinks, the app starts a category activity relating to drinks.  They then navigate to the drink activity by clicking on a drink.
