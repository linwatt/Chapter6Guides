If there’s no layout, how are we going to get the data in ListView? We can’t reference the *strings.xml* like we normally do

Using `android:entries` only works if the data is a static array in *strings.xml*. 

If you need to bind your list view to data held in something other than a string array resource, you need to take a different approach; you need to write activity code to bind the data. In our case, we need to bind our list view to the drinks array in the drinks class.
