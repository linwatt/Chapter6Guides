You make items in a list view to respond to clicks by using an **event listener**.

An event listener allows you to listen for events that take place in your app, such as when views get clicked, when they receive or lose the focus, or when the user presses a hardware key on their device. By implementing an event listener, you can tell when your user performs a particular action—such as clicking on an item in a list view—and respond to it.
