We’ll start by adding the `Drink` class to the app. *Drink.java* is a pure Java class file that activities will get their drink data from. The class defines an array of three drinks, where each drink is composed of a name, description, and image resource ID. 

Add the class to the *com.hfad.starbuzz* package in the *app/src/main/java* folder in your project, giving it a class name of `Drink`. Then save your changes.


The `Drink` code includes three image resources for its drinks with ids of `R.drawable.latte`, `R.drawable.cappuccino` and `R.drawable.filter`. These are so we can show the user images of the drinks.

`R.drawable.latte` refers to an image file called latte
`R.drawable.cappuccino` refers to an image file called cappuccino and `R.drawable.filter` refers to a file called filter.
