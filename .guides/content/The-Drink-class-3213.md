We’ll start by adding the Drink class to the app. Drink.java is a pure Java class file that activities will get their drink data from. The class defines an array of three drinks, where each drink is composed of a name, description, and image resource ID. 

Add the class to the com.hfad.starbuzz package in the app/src/main/java folder in your project, giving it a class name of Drink. Then save your changes.


The Drink code includes three image resources for its drinks with ids of R.drawable.latte, R.drawable.cappuccino and R.drawable.filter. These are so we can show the user images of the drinks.

R.drawable.latte refers to an image file called latte
R.drawable.cappuccino refers to an image file called cappuccino
and R.drawable.filter refers to a file called filter.
